# Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on building **Obelix**, a NixOS-based self-hosted infrastructure stack, and **SHARD**, a self-hosted advanced refinery for data. I also maintain and experiment with a number of other projects including **Starfront** (a Unity 6 sci-fi base-building game), **ArcusFlow** (an amateur athlete telemetry pod), and automation tooling like **Menhir** (Hydra-based CI orchestrator).

🌱 I’m currently learning **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)**, reproducible builds with Nix, and advanced DevSecOps practices.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Open-source NixOS modules and infrastructure tooling  
- Game development (Unity 6, systems/narrative design)  
- Wearables and telemetry (ArcusFlow hardware/software stack)  
- Self-hosted data aggregation, visualization, and analysis  

🤔 I’m looking for help with:
- Velocity Template Language (VTL) in CI/CD pipelines  
- Advanced Hydra CI integrations and GitHub status reporting  

💬 Ask me about:
- NixOS, Hydra, Kubernetes, GitOps, reproducible infra  
- Unity 6 development for sci-fi/strategy games  
- Amateur athlete tracking and telemetry design  
- Self-hosted data visualization (Grafana, Prometheus, PostgreSQL)  

📫 How to reach me: [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/shinedog)  

😄 Pronouns: He/Him  

⚡ Fun fact: All my infrastructure hosts are named after He-Man villains (Trapjaw, Beastman, Evil-Lyn, etc.), and Obelix’s environments are named after Asterix characters.
